#Goal: Define a function that takes in
#       a number and returns one more
#       than that number
def one_up(num):
    #you don't need to give num a value
    answer = num + 1
    #you don't need to print
    return answer

print(one_up(4))
result = one_up(99)+one_up(4)-one_up(19)
print(result)
